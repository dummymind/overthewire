Finding Your First Open Redirect!
You’re ready to find your first open redirect. Follow the steps covered in this
chapter to test your target applications:
1. Search for redirect URL parameters. These might be vulnerable to
parameter-based open redirect.
2. Search for pages that perform referer-based redirects. These are candi-
dates for a referer-based open redirect.
3. Test the pages and parameters you’ve found for open redirects.
4. If the server blocks the open redirect, try the protection bypass tech-
niques mentioned in this chapter.
5. Brainstorm ways of using the open redirect in your other bug chains!
