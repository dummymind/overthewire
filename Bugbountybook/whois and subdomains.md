For subdomain you can you use tools like

Sublist3r--Querying Search Engines and online Subdomain databases.
SubBrute-- Subbrute is a brute forcing tool that guesses possible subdomains
Amass-- Uses combination of DNS zone transfers,certificate parsing search engines and subdomains databases to find subdomains.

### About SecLists

SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.

## Commonspeak2

Commonspeak2 leverages publicly available datasets from Google BigQuery to generate content discovery and subdomain wordlists.

As these datasets are updated on a regular basis, the wordlists generated via Commonspeak2 reflect the current technologies used on the web.

By using the Golang client for BigQuery, we can stream the data and process it very quickly. The future of this project will revolve around improving the quality of wordlists generated by creating automated filters and substitution functions.

Let's turn creating wordlists from a manual task, into a reproducible and reliable science with BigQuery.

# Altdns - Subdomain discovery through alterations and permutations

Altdns is a DNS recon tool that allows for the discovery of subdomains that conform to patterns. Altdns takes in words that could be present in subdomains under a domain (such as test, dev, staging) as well as takes in a list of subdomains that you know of.

From these two lists that are provided as input to altdns, the tool then generates a _massive_ output of "altered" or "mutated" potential subdomains that could be present. It saves this output so that it can then be used by your favourite DNS bruteforcing tool.

Alternatively, the `-r` flag can be passed to altdns so that once this output is generated, the tool can then resolve these subdomains (multi-threaded) and save the results to a file.

Altdns works best with large datasets. Having an initial dataset of 200 or more subdomains should churn out some valid subdomains via the alterations generated.
